            <p><strong>Elijah Zare</strong>, known as <strong>"The Emerald Night,"</strong> was one of the <a href="union.html">Heroes of the Union</a> and the most enigmatic member of the group. A master infiltrator, spy, and intelligence operative, Zare's contributions to ending the <a href="civil-war.html">Civil Centennial War</a> were crucial but largely unknown to the public.</p>
            
            <p>Zare was known for his striking feminine appearance, which he used to his advantage in espionage work. He wielded two legendary daggers known as the Lesser and Greater of Two Evils. Much of Zare's life remains classified or unknown. He disappeared along with most of the other Heroes in 1970 A.U.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            
            <p>Almost nothing is known about Zare's early life. Records suggest he was born around 1862 A.U., possibly in Tekk territory, but even this is uncertain. Zare rarely spoke about his past, and what he did say was often contradictory - likely deliberate misdirection.</p>
            
            <p>What is known: Zare possessed exceptional skills in stealth, disguise, lockpicking, and information gathering from a young age. Whether these were learned or natural talents remains unknown.</p>
            
            <h2>Appearance and Identity</h2>
            
            <h3>The Feminine Appearance</h3>
            <p>Elijah Zare was male but possessed strikingly feminine features - delicate bone structure, graceful movements, and an androgynous beauty that made him appear as either gender depending on context. This natural ambiguity became one of his greatest assets as a spy.</p>
            
            <p>Zare could infiltrate spaces restricted to women or men with equal ease, often without needing elaborate disguises. His appearance allowed him to blend into any social situation, becoming whoever he needed to be.</p>
            
            <h3>The Emerald Night</h3>
            <p>Zare earned the epithet "The Emerald Night" during the war years. The name came from his signature emerald-green cloak and his habit of striking under cover of darkness. Enemies who encountered him described seeing only a flash of green before their secrets were stolen or their plans sabotaged.</p>
            
            <p>The name also referenced his eyes, which were described as a piercing emerald green that seemed to see through any deception.</p>
            
            <h2>The Legendary Weapons</h2>
            
            <h3>Lesser and Greater of Two Evils</h3>
            <p>Zare wielded two legendary daggers known as the <strong>Lesser of Two Evils</strong> and the <strong>Greater of Two Evils</strong>. The weapons were said to be enchanted, though the exact nature of their magic remains unknown.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Lesser of Two Evils</strong> was a shorter blade, approximately 8 inches long, with a emerald set in its pommel. Witnesses claimed it could cut through magical wards and barriers as easily as cloth.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Greater of Two Evils</strong> was slightly longer at 12 inches, with a darker emerald in its hilt. This blade was said to leave wounds that couldn't be healed by magic - only time and natural healing could mend them.</p>
            
            <h3>The Philosophy</h3>
            <p>When asked about the weapons' names, Zare reportedly said: "Sometimes you must choose between two evils. I simply carry both options."</p>
            
            <p>The daggers disappeared along with Zare in 1970 A.U. Their current location is unknown, though some believe they're hidden somewhere in the Undercity.</p>
            
            <h2>The Shadow War</h2>
            
            <h3>The Spy Who Served No One (1880-1920 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>For decades, both Magus and Tekk intelligence services reported encounters with a mysterious operative who seemed to work for neither side. This operative - later confirmed to be Zare - stole secrets from both factions and leaked information that prevented several major atrocities.</p>
            
            <p>Reports described "The Emerald Night" as a phantom who could be man or woman, young or old, depending on the situation. Zare's feminine appearance allowed him to infiltrate high society gatherings, military camps, and secure facilities with equal ease.</p>
            
            <p>Zare appeared to be conducting a personal war against the war itself, sabotaging operations that would have killed civilians or escalated the conflict unnecessarily.</p>
            
            <h3>The Undercity Network</h3>
            <p>Zare established an extensive network of informants, safe houses, and escape routes throughout what would become <a href="vyrodin.html">Vyrodin</a>. Much of this network operated in the underground tunnels - the foundation of the modern Undercity.</p>
            
            <h2>Joining the Heroes</h2>
            
            <h3>Recruited by Minoph (1921 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>How <a href="aceta-minoph.html">Archmage Minoph</a> found and recruited Zare remains classified. According to declassified documents, Minoph simply announced one day that "our intelligence specialist has joined us," and Zare was suddenly part of the team.</p>
            
            <p>Some accounts suggest Zare had been watching the Heroes for months, gathering information before deciding to join. Others claim Minoph used divination magic to locate them. The truth is unknown.</p>
            
            <h3>The Shadow Hero</h3>
            <p>Unlike the other Heroes who became public figures, Zare remained in the shadows. Most people didn't know he existed. This anonymity was Zare's greatest asset. When he did appear publicly, his feminine features often led people to underestimate him - a mistake they rarely made twice.</p>
            
            <h2>Covert Operations</h2>
            
            <h3>Intelligence Gathering (1921-1935 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>Zare's contributions to the Heroes' success were enormous but invisible:
            <ul>
                <li>Infiltrated both Magus and Tekk command structures</li>
                <li>Provided intelligence on troop movements and strategic plans</li>
                <li>Identified potential allies and threats</li>
                <li>Sabotaged operations that would have harmed civilians</li>
                <li>Gathered information on Tyrant Vaxara's defenses</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Known Operations</h3>
            <p>A few of Zare's operations have been declassified:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operation Silent Night (1932 A.U.):</strong> Prevented a Magus attack on a civilian shelter by stealing and destroying the attack plans</li>
                <li><strong>The Vaxhold Infiltration (1934 A.U.):</strong> Spent three months inside Vaxhold disguised as a servant, mapping the fortress</li>
                <li><strong>The Double Agent Network:</strong> Turned several enemy spies into double agents feeding false information</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Siege of Vaxhold</h2>
            
            <h3>The Inside Job</h3>
            <p>Zare's role in the siege was critical. He had already infiltrated Vaxhold disguised as one of Vaxara's courtiers - his feminine appearance allowing him to pose as a noblewoman for three months. When the siege began, Zare:
            <ul>
                <li>Provided real-time intelligence on Vaxara's forces</li>
                <li>Sabotaged key defenses at crucial moments</li>
                <li>Opened a secret entrance allowing the Heroes to penetrate the fortress</li>
                <li>Evacuated civilians through hidden tunnels</li>
                <li>Personally eliminated several of Vaxara's key lieutenants with the Lesser and Greater of Two Evils</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>The siege succeeded in part because Zare had already won half the battle before it began.</p>
            
            <h2>The Union Era</h2>
            
            <h3>Intelligence Services (1935-1970 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>After the war, Zare established the Union Intelligence Service. Unlike the brutal spy agencies of the war era, Zare's service emphasized:
            <ul>
                <li>Gathering information to prevent conflicts</li>
                <li>Protecting civilians from threats</li>
                <li>Ethical intelligence gathering</li>
                <li>Transparency with Union leadership</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Zare Doctrine</h3>
            <p>Zare developed principles for ethical espionage:
            <ul>
                <li>"Information saves lives; secrets cost them"</li>
                <li>"The best operation is one nobody knows happened"</li>
                <li>"Protect the innocent, expose the guilty"</li>
                <li>"Serve the people, not the powerful"</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Training the Next Generation</h3>
            <p>Zare personally trained Union intelligence operatives, though few ever met them face-to-face. Training often involved elaborate tests and challenges, with Zare observing from the shadows.</p>
            
            <h3>The Undercity Connection</h3>
            <p>Zare maintained close ties to the Undercity, ensuring it remained a refuge for those who needed to disappear. Some believe Zare lived in the Undercity rather than in official Union housing. Undercity residents remember him as someone who protected the vulnerable and asked nothing in return.</p>
            
            <h2>Disappearance</h2>
            
            <h3>The Final Mission? (1970 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>In the weeks before the disappearance, Zare was reportedly investigating "anomalous activities" related to the M.A.W. and ancient magical sites. Whether this investigation is connected to the disappearance is unknown.</p>
            
            <h3>The Empty Office</h3>
            <p>When Zare vanished, his office was found completely empty - no files, no personal effects, nothing. The Lesser and Greater of Two Evils were also gone. Either Zare cleaned it out before disappearing, or someone else did afterward. This has fueled conspiracy theories.</p>
            
            <h3>Theories</h3>
            <p>Given Zare's skills and paranoia, many believe:
            <ul>
                <li>Zare discovered something that required the Heroes' intervention</li>
                <li>The disappearance was a planned covert operation</li>
                <li>Zare is still alive, operating in deep cover</li>
                <li>Zare faked their disappearance and is watching from the shadows</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>Some Undercity residents claim to have seen a figure in an emerald cloak in recent years, but these sightings are unconfirmed. Others report finding emerald-green cloth scraps in places where someone recently helped those in need.</p>
            
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            
            <h3>Intelligence Services</h3>
            <p>The Union Intelligence Service continues to operate using Zare's methods and principles. While the <a href="church.html">Church of Embrace</a> now controls it, many operatives still follow Zare's ethical guidelines.</p>
            
            <h3>The Undercity</h3>
            <p>Zare's network of safe houses and escape routes still exists in the Undercity. Some are maintained by former operatives, others by Undercity residents who remember Zare's protection.</p>
            
            <h3>Cultural Impact</h3>
            <p>Zare represents the idea that not all heroes wear capes or seek glory. Sometimes the greatest contributions come from those who work in shadows, protecting others without recognition. His story also reminds people that appearances can be deceiving - that strength comes in many forms.</p>
            
            <p>The phrase "choosing between two evils" has become common slang in Vyrodin, often accompanied by a gesture mimicking drawing two daggers.</p>
            
            <h3>The Mystery</h3>
            <p>Zare remains the most mysterious Hero. Even basic facts about their life are uncertain. This mystery is fitting for someone who spent their life in shadows.</p>
            
            <p>Perhaps that's how Zare would have wanted it - remembered not as a person, but as an idea: that someone is always watching, always protecting, always working to keep people safe.</p>
            
            <h3>The Question</h3>
            <p>Is Elijah Zare truly gone? Or are they still out there, watching from the shadows, protecting The Union in ways we'll never know?</p>
            
            <p>Given Zare's skills and history, it's impossible to say for certain. And maybe that's exactly the point.</p>
