            <p><strong>Grezer the Steelskin</strong> is one of the legendary <a href="union.html">Heroes of the Union</a> and the only Hero confirmed to still be alive in 2005 A.U. A powerful barbarian warrior, Grezer earned his epithet "Steelskin" for his seemingly impenetrable hide and incredible resilience in battle.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike his fellow Heroes who mysteriously disappeared in 1970 A.U., Grezer remains among the living, though his current whereabouts and activities are largely unknown to the public.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            
            <p>Little is known about Grezer's early life before the <a href="civil-war.html">Civil Centennial War</a>. Historical records suggest he came from one of the Free Peoples' communities - neutral settlements caught between the Magus and Tekk factions. His natural combat prowess and legendary toughness made him a formidable warrior even in his youth.</p>
            
            <h2>The Civil Centennial War</h2>
            
            <h3>Rise to Prominence</h3>
            <p>Grezer first gained recognition during the middle period of the war (1860-1900 A.U.) as a warrior who fought for neither faction, instead protecting Free Peoples' communities from both sides. His reputation for being nearly unkillable earned him the name "Steelskin."</p>
            
            <p>Stories from this period describe Grezer surviving direct hits from Tekk artillery, shrugging off powerful Magus combat spells, and continuing to fight even when grievously wounded. Whether through natural resilience, magical enhancement, or sheer willpower, Grezer became a living legend.</p>
            
            <h3>Joining the Heroes</h3>
            <p>When <a href="aceta-minoph.html">Archmage Aceta Minoph</a> began assembling warriors to oppose Tyrant Vaxara in the early 1930s A.U., Grezer was among the first to join. His combat experience and unbreakable spirit made him invaluable to the group.</p>
            
            <h2>The Grezer Campaign</h2>
            
            <h3>Clearing the Southern Route (1903-1905 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>Grezer's most famous achievement came during what historians call "The Grezer Campaign." Between 1903 and 1905 A.U., Grezer led a series of battles to clear a strategic route through enemy-held southern territories.</p>
            
            <p>The campaign was brutal. Grezer and his forces faced constant attacks from both Magus and Tekk forces who wanted to control the route. Through sheer determination and tactical brilliance, Grezer held the line, allowing refugees and supplies to flow through safely.</p>
            
            <p>The route he cleared would later become the foundation for what is now <a href="vyrodin.html#grezer">Grezer's Path</a> district in Vyrodin.</p>
            
            <h3>The Final Battle (1935 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>Grezer fought alongside the other Heroes in the siege of Vaxhold and the final confrontation with Tyrant Vaxara. His role in the battle was crucial - while the mages dealt with Vaxara's magical defenses, Grezer led the ground assault, breaking through the tyrant's forces.</p>
            
            <h2>Post-War Years</h2>
            
            <h3>The Union Era (1935-1970 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>After the war, Grezer served on the High Council of The Union alongside the other Heroes. However, unlike his more politically-minded companions, Grezer preferred action to administration. He often traveled to troubled regions, personally dealing with threats to the new peace.</p>
            
            <p>During this period, Grezer became known as "The Union's Shield" - a protector who would appear wherever danger threatened the fragile peace.</p>
            
            <h3>The Disappearance Event (1970 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>In 1970 A.U., all the Heroes of the Union vanished simultaneously - except Grezer. The circumstances remain mysterious. Some accounts suggest Grezer was away on a mission when the others disappeared. Other theories propose he was deliberately left behind for unknown reasons.</p>
            
            <p>Grezer himself has never publicly explained what happened, leading to endless speculation.</p>
            
            <h2>Current Status</h2>
            
            <h3>The Living Legend</h3>
            <p>As of 2005 A.U., Grezer the Steelskin is confirmed to be alive, making him 140+ years old (exact age unknown). While this would be impossible for a normal human, Grezer's legendary constitution and possible magical enhancements have allowed him to survive far beyond normal lifespans.</p>
            
            <h3>Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
            <p>Grezer's current location is unknown. He occasionally appears in remote areas, helping communities in need, but he avoids public attention and refuses official positions. The <a href="church.html">Church of Embrace</a> claims to be in contact with him, but this has never been verified.</p>
            
            <p>Sightings are reported regularly:
            <ul>
                <li>Defending a village from bandits in the northern highlands (2003 A.U.)</li>
                <li>Seen in the Undercity of Vyrodin (2004 A.U.)</li>
                <li>Reported fighting monsters in the eastern wilderness (2005 A.U.)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Relationship with the Church</h3>
            <p>Grezer's relationship with the Church of Embrace is complicated. While he doesn't oppose them openly, he also doesn't support their governance. He represents a living connection to the original Union ideals, which some see as a challenge to Church authority.</p>
            
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            
            <h3>Grezer's Path</h3>
            <p>The southern district of <a href="vyrodin.html">Vyrodin</a> is named in his honor. A statue of Grezer stands at the district's center, serving as a symbol of resilience for residents. The district takes pride in its warrior heritage and community strength.</p>
            
            <h3>Cultural Impact</h3>
            <p>Grezer remains a folk hero, especially among working-class communities. His story represents the idea that ordinary people can become extraordinary through determination and courage. The phrase "tough as Grezer" is common slang for someone who refuses to give up.</p>
            
            <h3>Military Influence</h3>
            <p>Grezer's tactics and philosophy are still taught at military academies. His emphasis on protecting civilians and holding defensive positions has influenced Union military doctrine.</p>
            
            <h3>The Mystery</h3>
            <p>The greatest question surrounding Grezer is: why did he survive when the others disappeared? Theories include:
            <ul>
                <li>He was chosen to remain as a guardian</li>
                <li>His unique physiology prevented whatever happened to the others</li>
                <li>He refused to participate in whatever the Heroes were doing</li>
                <li>He knows what happened but is sworn to secrecy</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>Until Grezer chooses to speak, the truth remains unknown.</p>
