            <p>The <strong>Civil Centennial War</strong> (1835-1935 A.U.) was a devastating hundred-year conflict between the <a href="#">Magus Faction</a> and the <a href="#">Tekk Faction</a> over the fundamental question of whether magic or technology should guide civilization. The war ended with the intervention of the Heroes of the Union, who defeated both faction leaders and established <a href="union.html">The Union</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The conflict is considered one of the bloodiest in recorded history, with estimated casualties between 8-12 million. The war devastated the land, destroyed countless cities, and left deep cultural scars that persist to this day.</p>

            <h2>Origins</h2>
            
            <h3>The Philosophical Divide</h3>
            <p>The roots of the Civil Centennial War lay in a fundamental disagreement about the path of civilization. The Magus believed that magic - the manipulation of mana through will and training - represented humanity's highest achievement. The Tekk argued that technology - tools and machines that anyone could use - was the true path to progress.</p>
            
            <p>For decades, this remained a philosophical debate. However, as both sides developed increasingly powerful capabilities, tensions escalated. The Magus viewed Tekk machines as crude and dangerous. The Tekk saw Magus magic as elitist and exclusionary.</p>
            
            <h3>The Spark (1835 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>The war began with the Incident at Crossroads, a border town where both factions maintained presence. A Tekk factory explosion killed 47 people, including several Magus diplomats. The Magus claimed sabotage; the Tekk blamed Magus interference with their machinery.</p>
            
            <p>Within weeks, both sides mobilized for war. What was expected to be a brief conflict would last a century.</p>
            
            <h2>The Factions</h2>
            
            <h3>Magus Faction</h3>
            <p>Led by the Magus Archon, the Magus Faction controlled the northern and central territories. Their society was organized around magical ability, with powerful mages forming an aristocracy. They fielded armies of battle mages, summoners, and enchanted constructs.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Powerful individual combatants</li>
                <li>Magical healing and support</li>
                <li>Ability to create barriers and fortifications instantly</li>
                <li>Teleportation and rapid deployment</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Dependent on mana reserves</li>
                <li>Training took years</li>
                <li>Elite forces were irreplaceable</li>
                <li>Vulnerable to mana exhaustion</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Tekk Faction</h3>
            <p>Led by the Tekk Prime-Director, the Tekk Faction held the southern territories. Their society emphasized engineering, industry, and egalitarian principles. They fielded armies equipped with firearms, artillery, and mechanical vehicles.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Strengths:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Mass production of weapons and equipment</li>
                <li>Soldiers could be trained in months</li>
                <li>Superior logistics and supply chains</li>
                <li>Devastating artillery and explosives</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Dependent on supply lines</li>
                <li>Vulnerable to magical attacks</li>
                <li>Limited healing capabilities</li>
                <li>Mechanical failures in harsh conditions</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Major Phases</h2>
            
            <h3>Early War (1835-1860 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>The first 25 years saw rapid territorial changes. The Magus initially dominated with their superior individual power, but the Tekk adapted quickly, developing anti-magic tactics and overwhelming firepower. Neither side could achieve decisive victory.</p>
            
            <p>Major developments:
            <ul>
                <li>Magus develop combat enchantments and war golems</li>
                <li>Tekk create rifled firearms and explosive shells</li>
                <li>First use of mana-draining weapons by Tekk</li>
                <li>Magus counter with anti-technology hexes</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Middle War (1860-1900 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>The conflict settled into brutal stalemate. Trench warfare, siege battles, and attrition became the norm. Both sides committed atrocities. Entire cities were destroyed. The civilian population suffered enormously.</p>
            
            <p>This period saw the rise of legendary figures:
            <ul>
                <li>Grezer the Steelskin - Tekk warrior who cleared the southern route</li>
                <li>General Ostra - Magus commander known for tactical brilliance</li>
                <li>The Free Peoples - Neutral communities caught between factions</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Late War (1900-1935 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>The final decades saw escalating desperation. Both sides developed increasingly destructive weapons. The Magus created spells that could level cities. The Tekk built bombs that could create craters miles wide.</p>
            
            <p>By 1930 A.U., the war had reached a crisis point. Both factions were exhausted, their populations depleted, their lands devastated. Yet neither would surrender.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Battles</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Battle of Crossroads (1835 A.U.):</strong> The opening battle. Magus victory, but at high cost.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Siege of Ironhold (1847-1849 A.U.):</strong> Two-year siege of a Tekk fortress. Ended in stalemate after both sides exhausted resources.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Burning Plains (1872 A.U.):</strong> Massive battle involving 200,000 combatants. The plains still bear scars from magical and explosive devastation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Battle of Crystal Peak (1891 A.U.):</strong> Magus attempt to capture Tekk mining operations. Tekk victory using experimental weapons.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Grezer Campaign (1903-1905 A.U.):</strong> Series of battles where Grezer the Steelskin cleared the southern route, establishing what would become Grezer's Path.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Siege of Vaxhold (1935 A.U.):</strong> The final battle, where the Heroes of the Union defeated Tyrant Vaxara and ended the war.</p>
            
            <h2>End of the War</h2>
            
            <h3>Rise of Tyrant Vaxara</h3>
            <p>In 1933 A.U., a third faction emerged. Vaxara, a powerful mage who had mastered Tekk technology, seized control of the fortress city of Vaxhold. He declared himself Tyrant and began conquering territory from both factions.</p>
            
            <p>Vaxara's forces combined magical and technological warfare in ways neither faction had achieved. His rapid conquests threatened to unite the land under his brutal rule.</p>
            
            <h3>The Heroes of the Union</h3>
            <p>A group of warriors, mages, and engineers from both factions united to stop Vaxara. Led by Archmage Aceta Minoph, they included:
            <ul>
                <li>Aceta Minoph - Magus archmage and visionary</li>
                <li>General Ostra - Tactical genius</li>
                <li>Genius Glockius - Tekk artificer and inventor</li>
                <li>Others whose names are recorded in the Victory Monument</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Final Battle (1935 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>The Heroes laid siege to Vaxhold in early 1935 A.U. The battle lasted three months and was the most intense of the entire war. Vaxara's forces used every weapon at their disposal, but the Heroes' combination of magic and technology proved superior.</p>
            
            <p>The final confrontation took place on Victory Hill, where Archmage Minoph personally defeated Vaxara. With the Tyrant's death, his forces surrendered.</p>
            
            <h3>Aftermath of Victory</h3>
            <p>Rather than claiming victory for either faction, the Heroes declared the war over and both factions defeated. They established The Union, a new government that would combine the best of both philosophies.</p>
            
            <p>The Magus Archon and Tekk Prime-Director were forced to abdicate. A new era began.</p>
            
            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            
            <h3>Casualties and Destruction</h3>
            <p>The war's toll was staggering:
            <ul>
                <li>8-12 million dead (estimates vary)</li>
                <li>Countless wounded and displaced</li>
                <li>Dozens of cities destroyed</li>
                <li>Vast areas rendered uninhabitable by magical or chemical contamination</li>
                <li>Economic devastation across the land</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Cultural Impact</h3>
            <p>The war left deep psychological scars. Families had been divided, communities destroyed, entire generations lost. The integration of Magus and Tekk populations under The Union was challenging and sometimes violent.</p>
            
            <p>However, the war also demonstrated that neither magic nor technology alone was sufficient. The Union's philosophy of combining both approaches gained widespread acceptance, especially among younger generations.</p>
            
            <h3>Technological and Magical Advances</h3>
            <p>Paradoxically, the war drove innovation:
            <ul>
                <li>Magus developed practical combat magic that would evolve into modern spellcasting</li>
                <li>Tekk created manufacturing techniques still used today</li>
                <li>Both sides advanced medicine and healing</li>
                <li>The combination of approaches led to breakthroughs like spellarms and the M.A.W.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Remembrance</h3>
            <p>Today, the Civil Centennial War is remembered as a cautionary tale about ideological extremism. Remembrance Day (30 Autumn) honors those who died. Many battlefields have been preserved as memorials.</p>
            
            <p>The phrase "Never again a century of war" is taught to every schoolchild in Ohsa.</p>
