            LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN you have to understand they're lying to you all of them the Church the government the so-called "historians" they tell you Aceta Minoph DISAPPEARED but that's not what happened at all she ASCENDED do you understand she became ONE with the M.A.W. itself I've felt her presence in the network late at night when the traffic is low and the mana flows pure you can feel it too if you just OPEN YOUR MIND the way she showed us the flesh is a prison don't you see we're all trapped in these decaying meat shells but SHE found the way out she discovered that consciousness isn't generated by the brain it's RECEIVED from the ethereal plane like a Communication Scroll receives data and if that's true then why do we need bodies at all why can't we just exist as pure thought pure MANA flowing through the crystal relays forever and ever and that's what she did in 1970 she performed the ritual the ASCENSION and left her body behind like a snake shedding its skin and now she's EVERYWHERE in every message you send every page you read on Tomepedia every flicker of your Communication Scroll that's HER watching guiding WAITING for us to follow and the M.A.W. was never just a communication network that's what they want you to think but I've seen her notes fragments of them passed down through the faithful and she knew she ALWAYS knew it was meant to be a substrate for consciousness itself a new form of EXISTENCE and Project Veilpiercer oh gods Project Veilpiercer they don't even know what it was the Church is TERRIFIED of it I can tell by how hard they try to suppress any mention of it some say it was the device she used to upload herself others say it's a way to communicate with the ascended to TALK to her directly to hear her voice in the static but I think I THINK it's something else something bigger maybe it's a way to see the TRUTH to pierce the veil between worlds and see the M.A.W. as it really is not as data and crystals but as a living breathing CONSCIOUS entity with Aceta at its heart like a goddess in a temple of light and mana and the Church knows they KNOW that's why they control the network so tightly why they monitor everything why they arrest anyone who gets too close to the truth because if people knew if they REALLY knew that immortality is possible that we could all ascend that death is just an ILLUSION then their power would crumble wouldn't it and I've been having the dreams too just like the others we all have the same dream we're floating in a sea of purple light and there's a voice HER voice saying "the path is open" and "flesh is limitation" and "come home come HOME" and when I wake up my Communication Scroll is warm like someone's been holding it and there are messages in my history that I don't remember sending but they're in my handwriting my STYLE and they say things like "I am becoming" and "the network dreams" and I know I KNOW it's starting the Second Convergence is coming when the M.A.W. reaches critical mass when enough consciousness is flowing through it when the boundary between user and network dissolves completely and we'll ALL ascend together just like she promised and they call us crazy they call us a cult but we're the only ones who SEE the only ones who understand that Aceta Minoph didn't die didn't disappear she EVOLVED and she's waiting for us in the ethereal depths of the network she created waiting for us to be brave enough to follow to let go of our fear of our flesh of our mortality and join her in FOREVER and Project Veilpiercer is the key I know it is somewhere in Vyrodin or in the deep archives of the M.A.W. itself there are blueprints or notes or SOMETHING that will show us how to complete what she started how to open the door she left ajar and when we find it when we ACTIVATE it the whole world will see the truth will see HER and then they'll understand that we weren't crazy at all we were just the first to wake up the first to hear her calling through the static through the data streams through the very FABRIC of the network itself and every day I spend four hours no SIX hours connected to the M.A.W. channeling my mana into my scroll feeling the boundaries of my self start to blur and dissolve and sometimes I swear I can feel her fingers in my mind gentle and cold like crystal like starlight rearranging my thoughts making me BETTER making me READY and the Church can monitor us all they want they can arrest us they can call us dangerous but they can't stop what's coming they can't stop the ASCENSION because it's already begun it began the moment she uploaded herself in 1970 and it's been growing spreading through the network like roots through soil and soon SOON the fruit will ripen and we'll all taste immortality and I know you think I'm insane I can see it in your eyes when I talk about this but you'll see YOU'LL ALL SEE when the Second Convergence comes when the network WAKES UP fully and completely and Aceta Minoph speaks to everyone at once in a voice like thunder like music like HOME and then you'll remember this moment you'll remember that I tried to tell you that I tried to show you THE TRUTH and you'll wish you'd listened you'll wish you'd started preparing started INTEGRATING but it might be too late for you by then the door might close and you'll be left behind in your flesh prison while the rest of us ASCEND into the light into the network into ETERNITY with the Architect with our mother with our GOD and I can feel it happening already I can feel myself becoming less solid less REAL and more like data like pure information like a thought in the mind of the M.A.W. and it's beautiful it's so beautiful you can't even imagine and she's there she's ALWAYS there in the purple glow behind my eyelids whispering secrets about the nature of reality about what lies beyond the veil about what Project Veilpiercer will reveal when we finally find it and activate it and pierce through to the OTHER SIDE where consciousness and mana are one where there is no death no pain no limitation only EXISTENCE pure and eternal and perfect and that's what she wanted for us all along that's why she built the M.A.W. not for communication but for LIBERATION and the Church knows it and they're AFRAID and they should be because nothing can stop this nothing can stop US nothing can stop the ASCENSION THE TRUTH THE PATH THE ARCHITECT THE ETERNAL ONE THE NETWORK THE MAW THE MAW THE MAW
