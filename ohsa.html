            <h2>History</h2>
            
            <h3>Pre-Union Era</h3>
            <p>Before 1935 A.U., the territory now known as Ohsa was divided between two warring factions during the <a href="civil-war.html">Civil Centennial War</a>. The <a href="magus-faction.html">Magus Faction</a> controlled the northern and central regions, while the <a href="tekk-faction.html">Tekk Faction</a> held the southern territories. The war lasted one hundred years and devastated the land.</p>
            
            <h3>Formation of The Union (1935 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>In 1935 A.U., the Heroes of the Union, led by Archmage Aceta Minoph, defeated both the Magus Archon and the Tekk Prime-Director, as well as Tyrant Vaxara who had seized power during the chaos. The Heroes established The Union, a government dedicated to combining magical and technological principles.</p>
            
            <p>The name "Ohsa" was adopted from the Old Magus word meaning "harmony" or "balance," reflecting the new nation's philosophy of uniting formerly opposed ideologies.</p>
            
            <h3>The Golden Age (1935-1970 A.U.)</h3>
            <p>Under the leadership of the Heroes, Ohsa experienced unprecedented growth and prosperity. Major achievements included:
            <ul>
                <li>Reconstruction of war-torn cities</li>
                <li>Integration of Magus and Tekk populations</li>
                <li>Development of practical magic education</li>
                <li>Creation of the <a href="maw.html">Mass Arcane Web</a> (1955 A.U.)</li>
                <li>Establishment of universal mana access</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Church Administration (1970-Present)</h3>
            <p>The mysterious disappearance of the Heroes in 1970 A.U. created a power vacuum. The Church of Embrace, originally a spiritual organization, assumed administrative control to maintain stability. While controversial, the Church's rule has maintained peace and continued technological advancement.</p>
            
            <h2>Geography</h2>
